## Setup

- refer to documentation

## Implement features

- think: who, what, why
- business logic
- data model
- processing
  - define a route
  - get a request (input)
  - what kind of output, when and for who, if, map, filter,
  - return a response (output)
- hardcode
- dynamic data

## Stories

- As a researcher I want a list of names of my patients, so I know who is participating in my study
- As a researcher I want to be able to click on a name in the patient list, and see the details of a patient, so I can be informed

## What people think programming is

- write code (true, but..)

## What is programming

- look stuff up!
  - documentation
  - google
- scratch head, WHAT, im confus > 10 minutes -> slow
- reading code
- reading error messages
- experiment
- run your code, does this work?
- write code
  - copy paste
  - import from libraries
  - actually write your own

The fact that you're looking things up, being confused, reading, reading errors instead of writing code can ROCK your confidence

## How to deal with this

- Take break
- Discuss, how other people solved their problem
- Ask for help
- Positive self talk
  - I think -> I am dumb
    - It's not really true
    - This is actionable
  - I rephrase as -> I lack experience with this library, so I am learning how to use it
    - tutorial
    - look at example
  - I can do anything with enough time
